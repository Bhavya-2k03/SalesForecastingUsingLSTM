# Hi! Welcome to my repo :) 
The given csv should be in the following form for the model to work.
![Sales_template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100507234/205450679-6422bfa8-1f1d-4ce4-bba1-1f5f701add53.jpg)
The target coloumn is sales.  

There is no restrictions on the number of rows.  

Leave the rows of sales coloumn empty for which you want to predict the sales.  

Final predictions will be saved in a excel file in the working directory.
